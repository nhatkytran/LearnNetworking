+++ Part 1 - Network Devices +++

--> What is a network?
--> A computer network is a digital telecommunications network \
which allows nodes to share resources
+ Nodes --> Router, Switch, Firewall, Server, Client

--> What is Clients?
--> A client is a device that accesses a service made available \
by a server

--> What is a server?
--> A server is a device that provides functions or services \
for clients

--> What is a Switch?
--> Device used to forward traffic within a LAN - Local \
Are Network
--> Switch has multiple interafaces or ports to plug your PCs \
or Servers into

--> Routers?
--> Forward data over the Internet
+ have fewer network interafaces than switches
+ used to provide connectivity between LANs

--> Firewalls?
--> Network security devices that control network traffic entering \
and exiting network
+ can placed inside or outside
+ modern features --> next generation firewalls --> including things \
like IPS - Intrusion Prevention System
---
--> 2 types of firewalls
+ network firewalls --> hardware devices --> filter traffic between \
networks
+ host-based firewalls --> software applications --> filter traffic \
entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC

*** Point to note

--> The same device can be a clent in some situations, and a server \
in other situations

--> Cisco ASA stands for Adaptive Security Appliance. It is a security \
device developed by Cisco Systems that combines firewall, antivirus, \
intrusion prevention, and virtual private network (VPN) capabilities. \
It provides advanced security features and protects the network from \
internal and external threats --> Firewall

--> Cisco ISR stands for Integrated Services Router. It is a line of \
routers developed by Cisco Systems that enables multiple services to be \
integrated into a single device. The Cisco ISR family of routers is \
designed to provide secure, reliable, and high-performance connectivity \
for small to medium-sized businesses, as well as enterprise branch offices
--> Router

--> Cisco Firepower is a range of network security products developed \
by Cisco Systems that provide advanced threat detection and prevention \
capabilities. Cisco Firepower solutions combine leading-edge hardware \
and software technologies to provide unparalleled protection against \
various types of cyber threats, including viruses, malware, spyware, \
ransomware, phishing attacks, and more --> Firewall

--> Cisco Catalyst is a family of Ethernet switches developed by \
Cisco Systems. The Catalyst switches are widely used in enterprise \
networks to provide high-speed connectivity, security, and advanced \
features to support a variety of applications and services --> Switch

+++ Part 2 - Anki Flashcards +++

--> Anki --> Example of SRS --> Spaced Repetition Software

+++ Part 3 - Packet Tracer +++

--> In the world of IT, "doing labs" or "labbing" refers to hands-on practice \
with the technology being learned
--> CCNA --> labbing means practicing configuring Cisco routers and switches

--> ISR --> Integrated Services Router
--> A line of Cisco Routers
+ 2911 is a particular model in that line

--> Catalyst is the name of a line of Cisco switch models
+ 2960 is one model within that line

--> ASA --> Adaptive Security Appliance
--> A series of firewalls made by Cisco, and ASA5505 is a particular model \
within the ASA line
