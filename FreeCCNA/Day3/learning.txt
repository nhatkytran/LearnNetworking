+++ OSI Model & TCP/IP Suite +++

--> What is a networking model?
+ protocols --> A set of rules defining how network devices \
and software should work --> logical
--> Netowrking models categorize and provide structure for \
networking protocols and standard

--> Networks without standardization?
--> The OSI model attempts at standardizing network communications

--> OSI Model
--> OSI Model - "Open Systems Interconnection" Model
+ Open --> means that it is an open standard, not a proprietary \
model developed and used by an individual company
+ Layer 1 --> Physical layer --> The standards for cables and \
interfaces

--> OSI --> International Organization and Standardization

--> Layer 7 --> Application Layer
+ Encapsulation --> The data is processed through the OSI stack, \
each layer adding something the original data
+ De-Encapsulation
--> Both Encapsulation and De-Encapsulation processes are examples \
of "Adjacent-layer Interaction" --> Interaction between the different \
layers of the OSI model
--> The communication between the application layers of the two \
different systems is called "Same-layer Interaction"

--> Same-layer Interaction between application layers is what allows \
the application layer to perform its functions of identifying \
communication partners, synchronizing communications, etc.

--> Layer 6 --> Presentation Layer
+ The Presentation Layer translates data to the approriate format

--> Layer 5 --> Session Layer
+ Establish a session between two devices and ensures that the data \
is exchanged between them securely, reliably, and efficiently

--> OSI Model --> The Upper Layers - 5, 6, 7

+ Data prepared at the top 3 layers is then sent over to the bottom \
4 layers, which actually do the work of sending data over the network
+ After the top 3 layers hand data over to the bottom 4 layers. The \
next step before sending data is that Layer 4, the Transport Layer, \
adds a header in front of the data

--> Layer 7, 6, 5 --> Data is ready
+ then data is sent to Layer 4

[Data][L4 Header]

---

--> Layer 4 - Transport Layer
+ ([Unit of Data][Layer 4 Header]) --> Segment
+ Provides host-to-host communication services by ensuring the accurate \
and reliable transmission of data between hosts on a network

--> Layer 3 - Network Layer
+ ([Unit of Data][Layer 4 Header][Layer 3 Header]) --> Packet
+ Layer 3 - Router --> Provide Logical address and pick the best path

--> Layer 2 - Data Link Layer
+ ([Layer 2 Trailer][Unit of Data][Layer 4 Header][Layer 3 Header][Layer 2 Header])
--> Frame

--> Layer 1 - Physical Layer

---
Data --> Segment --> Packet --> Frame
DSPF --> Damn Squirrels Play Frisbee

--> PDUs --> Protocol Data Units
+ Segments is a term for Layer 4 PDUs - Protocol Data Units

+++ TCP/IP +++
All Time In LOL
+ Application
+ Transport
+ Internet
+ Link

--> Process to Process --> Application to Application --> Skype to Skype
--> Host to Host --> Router to Router

--> Adjacent Layer Interaction --> Encapsulation and De-Encapsulation
--> Same Layer Interation --> Host-to-Host, Process-to-Process

--> Encapsulation and De-Encapsulation starts from Layer 4 - Transport Layer
