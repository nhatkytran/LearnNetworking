+++ Interfaces and Cables +++

--> RJ45 --> Registered Jack
--> The RJ45 connector is used on the end of a copper Ethernet cable

--> What is Ethernet?
--> Ethernet is a collection of network protocols/standards
+ For example: Ethernet cable standards --> types of cabling is defined \
Ethernet standards

--> Network Protocols

--> Bits and Bytes
--> Connections between devices in a network operate at a set speed
+ These speeds are measured in pits per second
--> Bit --> 0 and 1 --> Binary code
8 bits = 1 byte
--> Speed is measured in bits per second (Kbps, Mbps, Gbps, etc). not bytes \
per second
+ Data on a hard drive is measured in bytes
---
- 1 kilobit (Kb) = 1,000 bits
- 1 megabit (Mb) = 1,000,000 bits
- 1 gigabit (Gb) = 1,000,000,000 bits
- 1 terabit (Tb) = 1,000,000,000,000 bits

--> Ethernet Standards
+ Defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard in 1983
+ IEEE --> Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers
++ 10BASE-T --> BASE (Baseband signaling) --> T (Twisted pair)

--> UTP Cables
+ Unshielded Twisted Pair Cables
+ Used in Ethernet Standards

--> Unshielded Twisted Pair
+ Unshielded --> the wires have no metalic shield --> prevent vulnerabilities \
from Electrical Interference
+ Twisted Pair --> 4 pairs of wires twisted together --> prevent vulnerabilities \
from Electromagnetic Interference or EMI

--> Not all the Ethernet standards use all 8 wires
+ 10BASE-T, 100BASE-T --> 2 pairs (4 wires)
+ 1000BASE-T, 10GBASE-T --> 4 pairs (8 wires)

--> UTP Cables (10BASE-T, 100BASE-T)
+ The network interface card on a PC or server transmits data on \
pins 1 and 2, and on a switch receive data on pins 1 and 2
+ Transmit (Tx)
+ Receive (Rx)

--> A switch transmits data on pins 3 and 6, PC or server receives \
data on pins 3 and 6

--> Full-Duplex Transmission
--> Full-Duplex Transmission means both devices can receive and \
send data at the same time
+ There is no problem like collisions will occur because they use \
separate wires to transmit and receive data

*** Point to note --> Ethernet uses Full-Duplex Transmission
+ So the two devices can send data at the same time with no issues

+ PC, Server, Router --> Tx 1 & 2; Rx 3 & 6
+ Switch --> Tx 3 & 6; Rx 1 & 2
--> Straight-through cable
+ Connects pin1 to pin1, pin2 to pin2, pin3 to pin3, etc.

--> A copper Ethernet cable has two RJ-45 connectors, one on each end

--> How about connecting 2 PCs or 2 Routers?
--> A crossover cable

--> Auto MDI-X allows devices to automatically detect which pins \
their neighbor is transmiting data on, and then adjust which pins \
they use to transmit and receive data

--> UTP Cables (1000BASE-T and 10GBASE-T)
--> In addition to using all four pairs of wires, in 1000BASE-T and \
10GBASE-T, each pair is bidirectional

--> Bidirectional means each pair isn't dedicated specifically \
to transmiting data or receiving data

--> Fiber-Optic Connections

--> SFP Transceiver --> Small Form-Factor Pluggable

--> Fiber Optic cable
+ Sends light over glass fibers
+ 2 connectors on each end, one connector to transmit data, and one \
to receive data

*** Point to note
--> The copper UTP cables used separate wire pairs within the cable \
to transmit and receive data
--> The Fiber-Optic cables instead use separate cables to transmit and \
receive data

--> Fiber Optic cable
+ 1. the fiberglass core itself
Light is transmitted down this core to transmit data from one device \
to another
+ 2. cladding that reflects light
+ 3. a protective buffer
+ 4. the outer jacket of the cable

--> Types of Fiber Optic cable
+ Single-mode fiber
+ Multimode fiber

--> Multimode fiber
