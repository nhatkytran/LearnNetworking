+++ Ehternet LAN Switching (Part 1) +++

--> Layer 1 - Physical Layer
+ Define physical characteristics of the medium \
used to transfer data between devices
(voltage levels, maximum transmission distances, physical connectors,...)
+ Bits are converted into electrical (for wired connections) \
or radio (for wireless connections) signals
+ Cables, pin layouts,...

--> Layer 2 - Data Link Layer
+ Provide node-to-node connectivity and data transfer
(PC to Switch, Switch to Switch, Router to Router)
+ Defines how data is formatted for transmission over \
a physical medium
+ Detects, (possibly) corrects Physical Layer errors
+ MAC Address
+ Switch

--> Ethernet involves Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI Model

--> LANs (Local Area Networks)
+ Basically, it's a network contained within a relatively \
small area, like an office floor or home network
+ Routers are used to connect separate LANs
+ Switches do not separate LANs but can be used to expand \
an existing LAN

*** Point to note
--> ETHERNET INVOLVES LAYER 1 AND LAYER 2 OF THE OSI MODEL

--> PDUs --> Protocol Data Units
(Ethernet Segment, Ethernet Packet, Ethernet Frame,...)

--> Ethernet Frame
[Ethernet Header][Packet][Ethernet Trailer]

--> Ethernet Frame Header
+ Preamble
+ SFD --> Start Frame Delimiter
--> Preamble and SFP used for synchronization and to allow \
the receiving device to be prepared to receive the rest of \
the data in the frame
+ Destination --> The Layer 2 address to which the frame is \
being sent
+ Source --> The Layer 2 address of the device which sent \
the frame
+ Type --> The Layer 3 Protocol used in the Encapsulated Packet, \
always is Internet Protocol (IPv4 or IPv6)
(sometimes is a length field - length of the encapsulated data, \
based on the version of the Ethernet)

--> Ethernet Trailer
+ FCS --> Frame Check Sequence --> Used by the receiving device \
to detect any errors that might have occurred in transmission

--> Preamble & SFD (Picture for more details)

--> Destination & Source (Picture for more details)
+ Indicate sending device and receiving device using MAC Address
+ MAC Address --> Media Access Control Address (6 bytes - 48 bits)

--> Type | Length (Picture for more details)
+ 2 bytes (16 bits) field
+ Value: <= 1500 --> indicates the LENGTH of the encapsulated \
packet (in bytes)
+ Value: >= 1536 --> indicates the TYPE of the encapsulated packet
(IPv4 or IPv6, LENGTH is determined via other methods)

PSDST --> Pets Small Duck Seven Times
+ Preamble --> 7 bytes --> 10101010 * 7 --> Synchronization
+ SFD --> Start Frame Delimiter --> 1 bytes --> 10101011
+ Destination --> MAC Address --> 6 bytes
+ Source --> MAC Address --> 6 bytes
+ Type | Length --> 2 bytes

--> Ethernet Trailer --> FCS --> Frame Check Sequence
+ 4 bytes --> 32 bits
+ detects corrupted data using CRC algorithm over the received data
+ CRC --> Cyclic Redundancy Check

*** Ethernet Fame header + Ethernet Frame Trailer --> 26 bytes

--> MAC Address (Picture for more details)

--> Decimal (Picture for more details)
+ 0 --> 0 value of 1
+ 11 --> 1 value of 10, 1 value of 1
+ 111 --> 1 value of 100, 1 value of 10, 1 value of 1

--> Hexadecimal (Picture for more details)
+ 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9, A, B, ..., E, F
+ A --> 10
+ F --> 15
--> 16 --> 10 --> 1 value of 16 and 0 value of 1
--> 17 --> 11 --> 1 value of 16 and 1 value of 1
--> 26 --> 1A --> 1 value of 16 and 10 value of 1
--> 31 --> 1F --> 1 value of 16 and 15 value of 1

--> MAC Addresses (Picture for more details)
+ The former 3 bytes --> The maker --> OUI
+ The latter 3 bytes --> Device

--> Unicast frames
Dest: .0002
Src: .0001
+ Unicast frame --> A frame destined for a single target

--> MAC Address Table / Dynamic [learned] MAC Addresses
+ MAC Address table of Switch learns MAC Address (Dynamic MAC Address)
+ Dynamic MAC Address or Dynamic learned MAC Address --> Switch learn \
it itself --> We don't configure it manually
+ Switch look at the Src MAC Address

--> Unknown Unicast Frame and Flooding
+++ Unicast Fame --> A fame for which a Switch doesn't have \
an entry in its MAC address table
+++ Flood --> Flood means to forward the frame out of \
All of its interfaces, except the one it received the frame on

--> Known Unicast Frame and Forwarding
+++ Known Unicast Frame --> the destination is already in its \
MAC Address table

*** Point to note
--> On Cisco switches, Dynamic MAC Addresses are removed from \
the MAC Address table after 5 minutes of inactivity

Switch receives Unicast frame

+ Look at Src to learn MAC Address
+ MAC Address table --> Dynamic [learned] MAC Address (MAC, Interface)
+ Remove after 5 minutes of inactivity

+ Look at Dest
+ Unknown Unicast Frame --> Flooding
+ Know Unicast Frame --> Forwarding
