+++ Intro to the CLI +++

--> Cisco IOS CLI

--> Cisco IOS
+ Operating systems used on Cisco Devices (like Window, MacOS)

--> CLI
+ Command-line Interface --> Used to configure Cisco Devices
--> GUI --> Graphical User Interface

--> How to connect to a Cisco Device?
--> Console Port
PC --> Console Port --> Cisco Device

--> Connect via a Console Port to configure Cisco device

--> Console Port
+ RJ45
+ USB Mini-B

--> Cable --> DB9 Connector + RJ45 --> Rollover cable
+ 8 pins on each end --> 1-8, 2-7, 3-6, 4-5, 5-4, 6-3, 7-2, 8-1
--> A type of Console cable used to connect a computer's serial port \
to the console port of a networking device using a command-line interface (CLI)

--> Serial Communication
--> Data is transmitted one bit at a time over a single communication line or interface
+ Key board connects to PC

--> Parallel Communication
--> Data is transmitted multiple bits at a time over communication lines or interfaces
+ PC connects to Printer

--> Console Communication
--> Allows computer to establish a direct connection to the management interface \
of the network device, allowing user to execute commands on the device to configure \
its settings
+ Laptop connects to a Switch using Rollover Cable

--> Terminal Emulator (PuTTy)

+ Session --> Serial --> Open: Connects to the CLI
+ Connection --> SSH --> Serial: Default settings of Cisco Devices

+ Speed (baud) --> baud rate: 9600
--> Data is transmitted at a rate 9600 bits per second (bps)
--> Serial communication like Switch and Router
--> If Baud rate mismatched --> data transmission may fail

+ Data bits: 8
+ Stop bits: 1
For each 8 bits of data, 1 stop bits is sent --> mark the end of the 8 bits

+ Parity: None --> Used to detect errors
+ Flow Control: None --> Control the flow of data from transmitter to receiver

--> Cisco's defaults
+ Speed of 9600 bits per second
+ 8 data bits
+ 1 stop bits
+ No Parity
+ No Flow control

--> Cisco IOS CLI
no
Press ENTER

--> User EXEC Mode --> user mode
ROUTER>
+ hostname of the device
+ > --> user EXEC mode

+ limied, can look at something, can not make any changes to the configuartion

--> Privileged EXEC Mode
ROUTER>enable
ROUTER# (# pound, hash sign)
+ View configuration, restart the device,...
+ Can not change the configuration, but can change the time on the device, save \
the configuration file,...

--> See all commands
+ ROUTER>?
+ ROUTER#?

--> Question mark
+ All cammands
+ Full word
+ Any option to provide

--> Cisco IOS CLI shortcuts
+ Press Tab --> en --> enable --> CLI automatically complete the word
(Ambiguous command: "e")
+ Display all the possible commands with e --> ROUTER>e?

--> Global Configuration Mode
ROUTER>enable
ROUTER#configure terminal
ROUTER(config)#

--> user EXEC mode --> privileged EXEC mode --> global configuration mode

--> enable password command
+ protect privileged EXEC mode with a password
? --> words
 ? --> Are there any option to provide
<cr> --> There's no option
enable password <PASSWORD> --> password is case-sensitive
exit

--> running-config / startup-config
ROUTER#show running-config
ROUTER#show startup-config
+ Default configuation

--> Saving the configuration
+ There are 3 ways to save the running-configuration to make it the start-up \
configuration

--> service password-encryption command
+ the number 7 means it is using Cisco's proprietary encryption algorithm

--> enable secret command
enable secret <password>
ROUTER(config)#enable secret Cisco
ROUTER(config)#do show running-config
--> Instead running show running-config in Privileged EXEC mode, use 'do' cammand
'do' <--> 'run'
+ Help run privileged-exec-level-command from global configuration mode

+ the number 5 --> MD5 Encryption

enable secret > enable password (both can exists together)
service password-encryption has NO effect on the enable secret

--> canceling / deleting commands
+ typing 'no' in front of the command
