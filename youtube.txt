+++ LAN - WAN - SUBNET +++

--> Network? --> A network is just computers connected to each other to exchange information
--> Now the most common way for computers connect to each other is by using Switch
--> Switch? --> A switch is a central wiring point with multiple ports \
so that two or more computers can connect to each other to create a network

  Computers <--> Switch    <-->  Gateway (Modem/Router)           <-->  Internet
[LAN - Local Area Network]      [ISP - Internet Service Provider]      [WAN - Wide Area Network]

--> LAN --> Local Area Network
--> LAN is a private network. It's a type of network like inside of a bulding (home, business, organization). \
So right now the computers in this network can only talk and exchange data with each other

--> Gateway --> Gateway is a Modem/Router combo

--> WAN --> Wide Area Network
--> A Wide Area Network is a large network of millions of computers \
that spans over a large geographical area (country, continent or even the entire globe) --> Internet

--> Subnet --> Subnetwork --> A division of a bigger network
--> Router --> Doorway or Gateway --> Devides or separates a network from another network
--> Reasons for creating subnets \
+ Manageability
+ Security
+ Performance

+++ VLAN +++

--> VLAN --> Virtual Local Area Network
--> VLANs --> VLAN enabled switch can logically create several virtual networks \
to separate the network broadcast traffic
+ Improved security
+ Traffic management
+ Make a network simpler
--> In a VLAN, the computers, servers, and other network devices are logically connected \
regardless of their physical location

+++ Subnets v/s VLAN +++

--> Subnets and VLANs are used to separate or break down a network into smaller network
+ Manageability
+ Security
+ Performance
--> Subnets separate networks physically
--> VLANs separate networks virtually

--> Subnet
+ Subnet stands for subnetwork
+ A subnetwork is a smaller network within a larger network
+ Subnets are created by using routers

[Computers <--> Switch] --> Broadcast domain

--> VLAN
+ VLAN are created on a VLAN enabled switch
+ The ports on a VLAN switch can be configured to separate network traffic

+++ LAN - WAN - CAN - PAN - MAN - SAN +++

--> PAN --> Personal Area Network --> Phones, Tablets, Desktops --> Bluetooth
--> WLAN --> Wireless Local Area Network --> is a LAN but with out using cables
--> CAN --> Campus Area Network --> A network that joins 2 or more LANs together within a limited area
--> MAN --> Metropolitan Area Network
--> SAN --> Storage Area Network

--> The most common type of LAN is an Ethernet LAN where two or more computers \
are connected to Ethernet cables using a Switch

+++ Hub - Switch - Router +++

--> Hubs and Switches are used to exchange data within a local area network

Hub --> Only detects that a device is physically connected to it
Switch
+ Can detect specific devices that are connected to it
+ Keeps a record of the MAC addresses of those devices

--> To exchange data outside their own network, a device \
needs to be able to read IP addresses --> A Router comes into play

--> Router --> A device that routes or forwards data from one network to another based on IP address
--> When a data packet is received from the router, the router inspects the data's IP address \
and determines if the packet was meant for its own network or if it's meant for another network
--> Receive data packet or send it off to another network
--> Router is essentially the gateway of a network

--> Hubs and Switches are used to create networks while Routers are used to connect network

+++ Modem +++

--> Modem is what brings the Internet into your home or business

--> A modem establishes and maintains a dedicated connection to your ISP to give you access to the Internet

--> Why do we need a modem? --> Two different types of signals that are used on a computer and on the Internet
--> A computer only reads digital signals, while signals out on the Internet are analog
          <-- Digital      [Demodulate]  <-- Analog
Computer                      Modem                   Internet
          --> Digital      [Modulate]    --> Analog
--> Modem demodulates incoming analog signals into digital signal
--> Modem modulates outgoing digital signals into analog signal

+++ Default Gateway +++

--> What is a Default Gateway? \
--> Simply put, a Default Gateway is a device that forwards data \
from one network to another. And the majority of the time, this is going to be a router

Computers <--> Switch <---> Router (Default Gateway) <--> Internet

--> A Default Gateway lets devices from one network communicate with devices on another network
--> "Default" means that designated device is the first option \
that's looked upon when data needs to exit network

--> Communicate on the same network --> Just talk directly
--> Communicate on different network --> Data needs to go through Default Gateway
--> How do computers know if another computer is on their own network or on a different network
--> IP Address comes into play

--> IP Address consists of 2 parts (Network address & Host address)
--> Which portion belongs to either the network or the host
--> Subnet Mask comes into play

--> Subnet Mask is a number that resembles an IP address
--> A Subnet Mask reveals how many bits in the IP address are used for the network \
by masking the network portion of the IP address

--> Check if computers on the same network using IP address & Subnet Mask
--> Same network --> Send an ARP broadcast out on the network to get MAC address of the targeted computer
--> Different network --> MAC address of Default Gateway --> Send data to Gateway --> Gateway routes or forwards \
data to the targeted computer on different network

+++ ARP - Address Resolution Protocol +++

--> Address Resolution Protocol - ARP used to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses
--> The MAC address is a physical address of a device. It's a globally unique number \
that is assigned to every Network Interface Card. Whenever a device needs to communicate \
with another device on a local area network, it needs the MAC address for that device \
and device uses ARP to acquire the MAC address

--> Knows IP address but still needs MAC address
--> An IP address is used to locate a device on a network
--> A MAC address is what identifies the actual device

--> Find MAC address
--> First, a computer looks at its internal list, called ARP cache to see if computer B's IP address \
already has a matching MAC address --> arp -a
--> Second, a computer sends out a broadcast message out on the network asking every device \
which computer has the specific IP address and will ask for their MAC address
--> Third, the computer that has the matching IP address will then response back and tell computer A its MAC address
--> and computer A stores this information in the ARP cache
--> Forth, the the computer A receives the MAC address, the communication can now take place between the two

--> ARP cache (table) is used to make a network more efficient --> Stores IP address to MAC address associations,
so that the next time it needs to communicate with a device on the network, it doesn't have to broadcast a message \
out on the entire network, it can just look in the ARP cache.

--> There are 2 types of ARP entries --> dynamic and static

--> A dynamic entry is created automatically when a device sends out a broadcast message out on the network \
requesting a MAC address
--> Dynamic entry is not permanent, they are flushed out periodically so that the cache doesn't get filled up \
with too many entires that are not being used

--> A static entry is where someone manually enters an IP address to MAC address association \
using the ARP command-line utility --> arp -s < IP address > < MAC address >
--> Administrator uses a static entries to reduce any unnecessary ARP broadcast traffic on a network
--> Static entries are ideal if you know two devices are constantly going to be communicating with each other

--> ARP cache (IP address and MAC address associations) + Switch (Remeber MAC addresses of the devices that is physically connected to it) \
--> Send data directly

+++ MAC Address +++

--> The MAC Address (Media Access Control Address) is an identifier that every network device \
uses to uniquely identify itself on a network

--> 00-04-5A-63-A1-66
--> It's made up of 6 byte hexadecimal number that is burned into every NIC (Network Interface Card)

--> The MAC address is broken up into 2 parts --> 00-04-5A and 63-A1-66
--> The first 3 bytes identify the manufacturer of the NIC (Network Interface Card) --> Linksys, Netgear, TP-link,...
--> The last 3 bytes are a unique number from the manufacturer that identifies each device on a network

--> The MAC address is also referred to as physical or hardware address

--> MAC addresses are formatted in different ways
+ Window --> 00-04-5A-63-A1-66
+ Apple or Linux --> 00:04:5A:63:A1:66
+ Cisco --> 00.04.5A.63.A1.66

--> What is the purpose of the MAC address?
--> The purpose of the MAC address is so network devices can communicate with each other

--> If devices talk to each other using the MAC address --> So, what is the purpose of an IP address?
--> Public and private IP addresses can periodically change --> Changed by network administrator, ISP,...
--> The MAC addresses don't change. They are permanent

--> Now the way TCP/IP works, which is the language that's used on networks and the Internet. \
A networking device needs both an IP address and a MAC address
+ An IP address is used to locate device
+ A MAC address is used to identify a device

--> Send ARP Broadcast to acquire MAC address
+ On the same network --> get MAC address of a device
+ On different network --> get MAC address of a default gateway

--> Each time data is passed between a computer or router, it uses the MAC address to forward the data \
at each step

-----------------------IP Address-------------------->
Computer ----------> Router ----------> Router ----------> Router -----------> Computer
-------> MAC address -----> MAC address -----> MAC address ------> MAC address

--> The IP address is used to locate and get to the final destination
--> The MAC address is used at each step on its way to the final destination

--> The Computer can have more than one MAC address, depends on how many Network Interface it has \
(Wire network adapter, Wireless network adapter, Bluetooth network adapter)

+++ IP address +++

--> IP address --> Internet Protocol Address

--> A numeric address
--> It's an identifier for a computer or device on a network
--> Every device has to have an IP address for communication purposes

--> Consists of 2 parts: A network address and A host address
+ The Network address identifies the specific network to which host is attached, \
and Host address uniquely identifies a host within a network
+ The distinction is important because router routes the packet according to \
a network address and don't care about host address

--> There are 2 types of IP address --> IPv4 and IPv6

--> IPv4

--> IPv4 is the current version (not for long) of IP addresses
--> 32-bit numeric address written as four numbers separated by periods
--> 11.11.11.[11] --> Octet [0 - 255] --> Each group of number is called Octet

--> Computer doesn't understand IP address in a numeric format: 66.94.29.13
--> Computer only understands number in a binary format: 01000010.01011110.00011101.00001101

--> 01000010.01011110.00011101.00001101
+ One Octet is 8 bit --> represented by a number from 0 to 255 --> IPv4 is 32 bit
+ Convert number in [0, 255] in binary format [2^7|2^6|2^5|2^4|2^3|2^2|2^1|2^0]
--> IPv4 produces over 4 billion address --> Not enough --> IPv6 comes into play

--> IPv6

--> IPv6 is the next generation of IP addresses
--> 128 bit hexadecimal address
--> 76DC:4F59:34CF:71CD:76DC:4F59:34CF:71CD (8 Octets)
--> Capable of producing over 340 undecillion (340 and 36 digits number) addresses
--> Binary format of IPv6 --> 8 Octets --> 16 bit --> Add up to 128 bit
--> Each hexadecimal character represents 4 bit [2^3|2^2|2^1|2^0] --> A --> F --> 10 --> 15

+++ IP address - Public v/s Private IP address +++

--> To be specific --> Talk about IPv4 addresses

--> There are two different types of IPv4 addresses --> Public v/s Private

--> Public IP Address

--> Order Internet Service from Internet Service Provider, they are going to assign your modem \
or your router in your home or your business a public IP address
--> Public IP address is registered on the Internet --> gives access to the WWW
--> Public IP addresses are unique

--> When IP addresses were first created, engineers didn't realize how BIG the Internet would become
--> With IPv4 address, we have more than 4 billion IP addresses available
--> In order to prevent a shortage of public IPv4 addresses, engineers developed private IP addresses

--> Private IP Address

--> Private IP address are not publicly registerd on the Internet \
--> You can't access the Internet using private IP address

PC (private IP address) <-----> Router (Public IP address) <-----> Internet

--> NAT (Network Address Translation) is what translates a set of IP addresses to another set of IP addresses
--> Private IP addresses to Public IP addresses and vice versa

--> Private IP addresses are only used internally (home, business, etc)
--> DHCP is a service in routers to assign private IPs

  Private IP address has 3 different classes

  Class       IP address range                  Default subnet mask
  
  A           10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255      255.0.0.0             --> Large Organization
  B           172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255      255.255.0.0           --> Medium Organization
  C           192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255     255.255.255.0         --> Small Organization or Home

  Public IP address                       Private IP address

  Unique                                  Non-unique. Can be used on other private networks
  Publicly registered on the Internet     Not publicly registered
  Used externally                         Used internally
  Assigned by an ISP                      Assignd by a router --> Using DHCP
  Not free                                Free
  Not secure                              Secure

--> Your private IP address is not exposed on the Internet but your public IP addres is --> VPN comes into play

+++ DHCP +++

--> DHCP --> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

--> Every computer on a network has to have an IP Address for communication purposes and IP Address as an identifier \
for a computer on a network
--> There are 2 ways that a computer can be assigned an IP address --> Static IP Address v/s Dynamic IP address
+ A static IP is where a user assigns an IP Address manually --> Have to make sure IP Addresses are unique --> If not, \
cause IP Conflict --> Computer doesn't get access to the Internet
+ A dynamic IP is where a computer gets an IP Address from a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Server

--> A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Server automatically assigns a computer an:
+ IP address
+ Subnet mask
+ Default gateway
+ DNS server

--> So as you can tell, dynamic IP Address is the best choice because it's automatic and it makes managing a network \
a lot easier

--> DHCP Server assigns IP addresses from its scope --> Its scope is customizable

--> Lease
--> The DHCP Server assigns the IP Addresses as a lease
--> A lease is the amount of time an IP Address is assigned to a computer
--> The lease is to help make sure the DHCP Server does not run out of IP Addresses

--> Address Reservation --> DHCP settings
--> A reservation ensures that a specific computer or device will always be given that same IP Address
--> Reservations are typically given to special devices or computers, such as network printers, servers, routers,...

--> DHCP is a service that runs on a server, such as a Microsoft Server or a Linux Server
--> It's also a service that runs on routers

+++ VPN +++

--> VPN --> Virtual Private Network
--> Establishes a secure and reliable network connection over an unsecure network such as the Internet
--> Protects you Internet activity and disguises your identity on the Internet

--> Your activity on the Internet will go through the VPN Server instead of ISP Server

--> Benefits of VPN

--> First
--> A VPN will disguise your identity by hiding you IP address
--> Websites will see VPN IP Address instead of your IP Address

--> Second
--> A VPN will encrypt and protect your Internet data
--> Data --> Packets --> Go through the Internet (Can be viewed by ISPs, governments or intercepted by hackers, \
especially public Wifi networks) --> Using VPN to prevent this
--> A VPN encapsulates the data with an extra layer of protection to each one packet which is known as tunneling
--> Data packets travel across the Internet in a virtual tunnel

--> Third
--> You will be able to access Internet content that would normally be restricted in certain geographical \
locations

--> Fourth
--> VPN provides a secure connection for remote workers

+++ DNS +++

--> DNS --> Domain Name System
--> Resolves names to numbers --> Resolves domain names to IP addresses

--> Protocol / Sub Domain / Domain Name / Second Level Domain (SLD) / Top Level Domain (TLD) / Path / File Name

--> Computer (Cache) --> Resolver Server (Cache) - ISP -->

--> Root Server
--> The top or the root, of the DNS hierarchy
--> 13 sets of these root servers strategically placed around the world
--> Operated by 12 different organizations
--> Each set has their own unique IP address

--> TLD Server --> Top Level Domain Server
--> Stores the address information for top level domains, such as .COM, .NET, .ORG,...

--> Authoritative Name Server
--> Responsible for knowing everything about the domain, including the IP Address

+++ DDNS +++

--> DDNS --> Dynamic Domain Name System

--> DNS transforms a domain name into an IP Address
--> In a DNS database, a domain name is mapped or joined with an IP Address --> Must (should) be \
a static IP Address
--> It could take up to 24 hours for DNS to update their database

--> DNS is used with static IP Addresses
--> Dynamic DNS is used with dynamic IP Addresses

--> Dynamic DNS allows you to access devices in your home from anywhere in the world
--> Dynamic DNS allows you to access your home computer even if your IP Addresses changes

--> No matter how many times your IP changes, it doesn't matter
--> You would always use your custom hostname instead of your IP
--> Dynamic DNS will always make sure that the correct IP Address is mapped to your custom hostname

+++ Subnet Mask +++

--> IP Address --> An IP Address is an identifier for a computer or device on a network
--> Every device has to have an IP Address for communication purposes
--> To be specific --> IPv4 - 32-bit numeric address, written as 4 numbers, separated by periods --> Octet [0, 255]
--> IP Address consists of 2 parts: Network Address and Host Address --> Host such as computer

--> Which part of the IP Address is Network Address or Host Address --> Use Subnet Mask

--> Subnet Mask
--> Subnet Mask is the number that resembles IP Address
--> A Subnet Mask reveals how many bits in the IP Address are used for the Network by masking \
the Network portion of the IP Address

--> 192 . 168 .  1  . 0
--> 255 . 255 . 255 . 0

--> Computer doesn't understand the decimal format, computer can only understand the binary format --> 1s and 0s

--> 110000 . 10101000 . 00000001 . 00000000
--> 111111 . 11111111 . 11111111 . 00000000
--> [     Network Portion      ]   [ Host Portion ]

--> One more example

--> 172 . 16  .  1  . 0
--> 255 . 255 . 224 . 0

--> 10101100 . 00010000 . 00000001 . 00000000
--> 11111111 . 11111111 . 11100000 . 00000000
--> [    Network Portion    ][ Host Portion ]

--> Why does an IP Address have a Network and a Host part?

--> The reason is Manageability --> Break down a large network into smaller network --> Sub network --> aka Subneting
--> IP Addresses have a network and a host part, so networks can be logically broken down into smaller networks, \
which is known as subneting

--> The way to break down a network into smaller networks is by subnetting
--> Subneting is done by changing the default Subnet Mask \
by borrowing some of the bits from the host portion

--> 255 . 255 . 255 . 0
--> 111111 . 11111111 . 11111111 . 00000000

--> 1 network with 254 hosts (substract all 0s and 1s)

--> All 0s --> 192.168.1.0 / 24 --> represents network address of the Subnet
--> It cannot be assigned to any individual host within that subnet
--> This means that the IP address is referring to the entire subnet rather than a specific host within that subnet

--> All 1s --> 192.168.1.255 / 24 --> represents the broadcast address of the subnet
--> Sending a packet to this address will send the packet to all hosts within that subnet

--> Borrow x bit from host portion
--> 2 ^ x subnets
--> Each subnet --> 2 ^ (s - x) - 2(0s and 1s) host addresses

--> Class of Subnet Mask --> 5 Classes A - E, but 3 classes A, B and C are for commercial use

Class      First Octet of IP Address      Default Subnet Mask
  A               1 - 126                     255.0.0.0          --> Large Organization
  B               128 - 191                   255.255.0.0        --> Medium Organization
  C               192 - 223                   255.255.255.0      --> Small Organization

--> CIDR --> Classless Inter-Domain Routing (slash notation)

--> Subnet Mask can also be expressed in a different method called CIDR
--> CIDR --> Classless Inter-Domain Routing --> A shorter way to write a subnet mask
--> 192.168.1.0 /24 --> Subnet Mask --> 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

+++ DNS Records +++

--> DNS --> Domain Name System --> Resolves Domain Names to IP Addresses

--> In a DNS hierarchy, there are 3 main levels of servers
--> The Root servers
--> The Top Level Domain servers
--> The Authoritative Name servers

--> The Authoritative Name Servers are responsible for storing the DNS records for resolving \
Domain Names to IP Addresses
--> Because the Authoritative Name Servers are responsible for knowing everything about a domain

--> Which Authoritative Name Server to ask?
--> Root Servers --> Top Level Domain Servers (.com, .vn, .org) --> Authoritative Name Servers

--> DNS database has a zone file
--> The zone file contains the DNS records

--> DNS Records

--> The A record resolves Domain Names to IP Addresses (IPv4 - 32 bits numeric address)
--> Type, Name, IP Address, TTL
--> TTL --> Time To Live --> Tell how long each record is valid until the next update

--> The quad A records (AAAA) --> IPv6 - 128 bits alpha numeric address

--> The CNAME record --> The Canonical Name record
--> The CNAME record (The Canonical Name record) resolves a Domain or Sub Domain to another \
Domain Name

--> Computers read Domain Names from right to left
--> www.example.com.
. --> Root domain --> Hidden
com --> TLD --> Top Level Domain
example --> Domain name --> Also SLD - Second Level Domain cause it stands before TLD
www --> Sub Domain

www.example.com --> The CNAME Record (The Canonical Name Record) --> example.com

--> Subdomains are also often used when a websites has different services running on the same \
server and are using the same IP Address --> ftp.example.com

--> The A records resolve Domain Names to IP Addresses while The CNAME records resolve Domain \
Names to Domain Names

...

Some of the most commonly used DNS record types include:

A record: maps a domain name to an IPv4 address
AAAA record: maps a domain name to an IPv6 address
CNAME record: maps a domain name to another domain name (canonical name)
MX record: specifies the mail servers responsible for accepting email messages for a domain
TXT record: allows domain owners to insert arbitrary free-form text into a DNS record
NS record: specifies the authoritative nameservers for a domain

+++ Port Forwarding +++

--> Port Forwarding allows computers over the Internet to connect to a specific computer \
or service within a private network
--> Make computer accessable over the Internet, even though the computer is behind a router

--> Example: A friend is going to connect to a computer using RDC - Remote Desktop Connection
--> Send a request to Public IP Address with a specific port number - 66.94.34.13:3389

--> A Port is a logical connection that is used by programs and services to exchange information
--> Ports uniquely identify programs and services that are running on a computer

+ Router needs to know where to forward the request for port 3389
+ Without any port forwarding configured, router does not know what to do with the request
--> This is where Port Forwarding comes in

--> We're going to tell our router to send or forward any requests that come in with port 3389 \
and send the request to computer
--> We need to log into the router's configuration page by typing the router's internal IP Address
using a Web browser

--> Ports
--> Ports are always associated with an IP Address
--> Ports are identified by a unique number
--> The IP Address purpose is determined by the port number
+ Ports numbers range from 0 - 65535
+ Ports used on a daily basis
- 80 --> HTTP
- 443 --> HTTPS
- 20, 21 --> FTP

+++ Ports +++

--> What is a port?

--> A port is no a physical connection
--> It's a logical connection that's used by programs and services to exchange information
--> It's specifically determines which program or service on a computer or server that is \
going to be used --> Web page, FTP, Email,...

--> Ports will have a unique number that identifies them --> 0 - 65535

--> Common port numbers
+ 80, 443 --> Web pages (HTTP, HTTPS)
+ 21 --> FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
+ 25 --> Email (SMTP)

--> A port is always associated with an IP Address
--> IP Address
+ Numeric Address
+ Identifier for a device on a network
+ A device has to have an IP Address for communication purposes

--> An IP address determines the location of the server
--> A port number determines which service or program on the server it wants to use

--> Netstat --> netstat -n
--> Netstat --> Setwork Statistics --> Command line tool that is used to display the current \
network connections and port activity on computer

--> Port numbers range from 0 - 65535
--> They are assigned by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)

--> Port numbers are broken down into 3 categories

+ Port numbers 0 - 1023 are called System or Well-known Ports
- These are common ports that people use every day (80, 443,...)

+ Port numbers 1024 - 49151 are called User or Register ports
- These are ports that can be registered by companies and developers for a \
particular service
- 1102 - Adobe Server, 1433 - Micrpsoft SQL Server,...

+ Port numbers 49152 - 65535 are called Dynamic or Private ports
- These are client0side ports that are free to use
- These are ports that computers assign temporarily to itself during a session

--> netstat -an
--> Example: Run React App on a computer --> 127.0.0.1
tcp4       0      0  127.0.0.1.3000         127.0.0.1.51308        ESTABLISHED
tcp4       0      0  127.0.0.1.51308        127.0.0.1.3000         ESTABLISHED

+++ Netstat +++

--> Netstart --> Network Statistics
--> Command line tool that is used to display the current network connections \
and port activity on computer
--> Available on various operating systems

netstat

Active Internet Connections
Proto - Local Address - Foreign Address - State

netstat -n
--> Netstat can be combined with subcommands or switches to alter the output

+++ Ipconfig +++

--> Cpmputer has both IPv4 and IPv6 --> Dual Stack --> Compatibility purposes

+++ Ping Command +++

+++ Traceroute +++

--> Find the path packets take to their destination
--> Can help find problems, like bottle necks

traceroute google.com

+++ Ping and Tracert (Traceroute) +++

+++ Proxy Server +++

--> Proxy Server --> Retrieves data on the Internet on behalf of a user

--> Why do we want to use a Proxy server?
+ Without using a Proxy, your public IP address is visible
+ Cached Web Page Database on Proxy Server --> Speed and Save bandwidth
+ Activity logging

--> Proxy Server can not encrypt data
--> VPN --> Virtual Private Network
+ A VPN encrypts the data that's being transferred over the Internet
+ Provides a dedicated secure tunnel between 2 points over the Internet

+++ Virtual Machines and Containers +++

--> The traditional way a business operates is by applications running on servers
--> One application on one server
--> The Operating System didn't have the capability to run multiple applications \
securely on a single server
--> They would have to buy a new server for new application to run on
--> Applications couldn't take full advantage of a server's capability
--> Running one application on one server turned out to be a waste of money

--> VMS - Virtual Machines
--> Allow multiple applications to run on a single server by simulating hardware \
and software

--> Server / Hardware --> Hypervisor --> Virtual machines --> Applications

--> Hypervisor
+ Allows one machine to run multiple virtual machines
+ Allocates and controls the sharing of machine's hardware

--> Virtual machines
+ Each virtual machine will have their own operating system (Window, Linux, Unix,...)

--> Virtual machine disadvantages
+ Consume a lot of disk space
+ Consume a lot of RAM and CPU power from the server
+ Slow to start up
+ Requires a license for each operating system

--> Containers
--> Containers are similar to VMS - Virtual machines but the major difference is that \
+ VMS simulate the entire machine
+ Contianers only contain an application

--> A container is an application that's been packaged with all the...
+ Files
+ Configurations
+ Dependencies
...necessary for it to run

--> A container is bundled with everything that it needs to run on any Computing Environment \
without adding anything else to that computer

--> The leading software that is used to create, manage, and run container is ... docker

--> Server / Hardware --> Operating System --> Container Engine --> Applications

--> Container Engine --> The Container Engine is what unpacks the container files \
and hands them off to the Operating Systen kernel

--> Containers
+ Smaller file size
+ Considered light weight
+ LIGHTNING fast
+ Consume less RAM and CPU power
+ Ultra portable

--> Container disadvantages
+ Container must be packaged to work with the same Operating System of the server
+ If the server Operating System crashes, then the containers will go down

--> Virtual machines and Containers can be used on the same machine
