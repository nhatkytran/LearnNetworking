SECTION - 3

1. What is a network?
--> Social media network
--> A computer network --> Digital telecommunications
Why do we need a computer network? --> Share resources between nodes
nodes --> computing devices --> files, share a printer (an end device),...
Share resources using Data-Link (media) --> Fiber optic cable, Wifi,...
Sneakernet (Floppy disk, USB - Universal Serial Bus,...)

2. Most basic type of network
Internet (Networks...)
--> Copper Ethernet Cable
--> UTP --> Unshielded Twisted Pair copper cable --> RJ45 Connector
Computer --> Network Interface Card --> RJ45 <-- NIC <-- PC
Network Interface Card (NIC) has MAC address (Media Access Control address)
--> A MAC address (A Media Access Control address) \
is a unique identifier assigned to a Network Interface Controller (NIC) \
for use as a network address in communications within a network segment
NIC and Wireless NIC
10base5 --> 10base2 --> RJ45
Adapter (convert port)
---------[]
Cat5e Ethernet cabling UTP - RJ45 Connector
Use Wifi to share file (Wifi in this context is medium or media)
--> Airdrop creates its own Wifi network that allows two devices \
to share files without the need for any other Wifi networks

3. A bit of networking history
Ethernet starts with 10base5 --> bus network or bus topology
device --> data --> medium --> data --> device
Cat = Category of cable --> In general, higher numbers represent faster speeds \
and higher frequencies, measured Mhz
thinnet v/s thicknet
phone has built-in Wireless NIC

4. Servers, Clients, Ports and Protocols
Why we need a network? Share resources between nodes
--> Client - Server model
--> Server --> provides a service or functionality to clients \
in what's called a client - server model
--> Client accesses a service provided by a server, \
typically, the server is a different computer or different computing device \
to the client across a network
==> So we are going to access a service hosted by a server across a network
--> Server --> Distributed server for handling milliions of requests
--> Server will be listening on different port numbers for different protocols
--> Protocols --> Basically a set of rules (a set of conventions) \
used for communication between devices
--> HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol --> uses Port 80
--> HTTPS: Hypertext TransferProtocol Secure --> uses Port 443
--> FTP: File Transfer Protocol --> uses Port 21 (and 20)
--> Server can run multiple services and provide multiple services to clients \
in client - sever model
http is the protocol.
--> A port is like an application on the server, so if you want to access \
this certain application, you have to request its protocol,
--> There are often many ports are opened on one server, \
each port is associated with a specific service on the server.
--> http://example.com:80
:// is just syntax.
example.com is the domain.
example is the domain name.
.  is just syntax too.
com  is the top-level domain.
:  is just syntax too.
80 is the port number.
