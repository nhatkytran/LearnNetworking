SECTION - 3

1. What is a network?
--> Social media network
--> A computer network --> Digital telecommunications
Why do we need a computer network? --> Share resources between nodes
nodes --> computing devices --> files, share a printer (an end device),...
Share resources using Data-Link (media) --> Fiber optic cable, Wifi,...
Sneakernet (Floppy disk, USB - Universal Serial Bus,...)

2. Most basic type of network
Internet (Networks...)
--> Copper Ethernet Cable
--> UTP --> Unshielded Twisted Pair copper cable --> RJ45 Connector
Computer --> Network Interface Card --> RJ45 <-- NIC <-- PC
Network Interface Card (NIC) has MAC address (Media Access Control address)
--> A MAC address (A Media Access Control address) \
is a unique identifier assigned to a Network Interface Controller (NIC) \
for use as a network address in communications within a network segment
NIC and Wireless NIC
10base5 --> 10base2 --> RJ45
Adapter (convert port)
---------[]
Cat5e Ethernet cabling UTP - RJ45 Connector
Use Wifi to share file (Wifi in this context is medium or media)
--> Airdrop creates its own Wifi network that allows two devices \
to share files without the need for any other Wifi networks

3. A bit of networking history
Ethernet starts with 10base5 --> bus network or bus topology
device --> data --> medium --> data --> device
Cat = Category of cable --> In general, higher numbers represent faster speeds \
and higher frequencies, measured Mhz
thinnet v/s thicknet
phone has built-in Wireless NIC

4. Servers, Clients, Ports and Protocols
Why we need a network? Share resources between nodes
--> Client - Server model
--> Server --> provides a service or functionality to clients \
in what's called a client - server model
--> Client accesses a service provided by a server, \
typically, the server is a different computer or different computing device \
to the client across a network
==> So we are going to access a service hosted by a server across a network
--> Server --> Distributed server for handling milliions of requests
--> Server will be listening on different port numbers for different protocols
--> Protocols --> Basically a set of rules (a set of conventions) \
used for communication between devices
--> HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol --> uses Port 80
--> HTTPS: Hypertext TransferProtocol Secure --> uses Port 443
--> FTP: File Transfer Protocol --> uses Port 21 (and 20)
--> Server can run multiple services and provide multiple services to clients \
in client - sever model
http is the protocol.
--> A port is like an application on the server, so if you want to access \
this certain application, you have to request its protocol,
--> There are often many ports are opened on one server, \
each port is associated with a specific service on the server.
--> http://example.com:80
:// is just syntax.
example.com is the domain.
example is the domain name.
.  is just syntax too.
com  is the top-level domain.
:  is just syntax too.
80 is the port number.

5. Practical Demonstration using Packet Tracer
--> In networking we use network diagrams to explain what a network looks like
--> Straight Through Ethernet Cable v/s Crossover Ethernet Cable (1 - 3, 2 - 6) (8)
--> Straight Through Ethernet Cable --> Computer with Modem/Hub/Router --> Not same
--> Crossover Ethernet Cable --> Computer with Computer / Router with Router --> Same
--> Back in the day, use Crossover Cable to allow PC to talk to PC
--> These days, we use Auto MDI-X ports to fix this issue
--> Auto MDI-X ports on a new network interfaces detect if the connection \
would require a crossover, and automatically chooses the MDI or MDI-X configuration \
to properly match the other end of the link
--> MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers, and are \
therefore often refered to as the burned-in address, or Ehternet hardware address, \
hardware address, and physical address
--> Each address can be stored in hardware, such as the card's read-only memory, \
or by firmware mechanism
--> Firmware is software that provides basic machine instructions \
that allow the hardware to function and communicate with other software \
running on a device. Firmware provides low-level control for a device's hardware
--> To allow 2 devices to communicate to each other, we need a MAC address and \
an IP address
+++ MAC address +++
--> MAC addresses are recognizable by hyphens, colons, or without a separator
--> MAC addresses: 0003.E435.C7DE or 11.22.11.22.11.22
--> Practice --> Change MAC address --> 0001.1111.1111 & 0001.2222.2222
+++ IP address +++
In network, a server (which could be a home router)
--> allocate IP addresses to PC using a protocol using DHCP (a network management protocol)
--> DHCP is allocating IP addresses to PC
--> DHCP --> The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol \
is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol networks \
whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and \
other network configuration protocol parameters to each device on a network \
so they can communicate with other IP networks
--> PC has received an IP address automatically from a DHCP server or \
it could be configured statically
--> In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer needs to be manually assigned \
an IP address, or it can use a special link local IP address to allow \
communication on the local network
--> Pratice --> Change IP Address and Subnet Mask
--> IP Address --> PC - 10.1.1.1 --> Server - 10.1.1.2
--> Subnet Mask --> 255.255.255.0
--> On the PC, use a special application called Ping \
to verify connectivity to the server (ping 10.1.1.2) \
to verify that server is up
--> Ping on Client says 'Hello server! Are you there?'
--> Server replies back 'Yes! I'm here!'
--> The point --> Notice a whole bunch of services running on a server \
HTTP, FTP, DNS, Email,...
--> DNS --> Domain Name System --> allows to resolve domain names \
such as Google.com, Facebook.com to an IP address
--> The server is configured with the HTTP Service and \
it's serving a web page to the client when the client requests a web page
--> Simulation mode of Packet Tracer --> OSI model & TCP/IP model
--> TCP - Transmission Control Protocol --> gives us reliability \
in a network transmission
--> The client talks to the server on port 80 and then \
the server replies back from port 80 to a port number \
that the client randomly decided to use
