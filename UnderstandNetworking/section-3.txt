SECTION - 3

1. What is a network?
--> Social media network
--> A computer network --> Digital telecommunications
Why do we need a computer network? --> Share resources between nodes
nodes --> computing devices --> files, share a printer (an end device),...
Share resources using Data-Link (media) --> Fiber optic cable, Wifi,...
Sneakernet (Floppy disk, USB - Universal Serial Bus,...)

2. Most basic type of network
Internet (Networks...)
--> Copper Ethernet Cable
--> UTP --> Unshielded Twisted Pair copper cable --> RJ45 Connector
Computer --> Network Interface Card --> RJ45 <-- NIC <-- PC
Network Interface Card (NIC) has MAC address (Media Access Control address)
--> A MAC address (A Media Access Control address) \
is a unique identifier assigned to a Network Interface Card (NIC) \
for use as a network address in communications within a network segment
NIC and Wireless NIC
10base5 --> 10base2 --> RJ45
Adapter (convert port)
---------[]
Cat5e Ethernet cabling UTP - RJ45 Connector
Use Wifi to share file (Wifi in this context is medium or media)
--> Airdrop creates its own Wifi network that allows two devices \
to share files without the need for any other Wifi networks

--> Twisted Pair Cable --> Used on Local Area Network
--> 568A & 568B --> Straight Through Ethernet Cable
--> Connect dissimilar divices --> Computer to (Switch, Router, Modem)
--> 568A

3. A bit of networking history
Ethernet starts with 10base5 --> bus network or bus topology
device --> data --> medium --> data --> device
Cat = Category of cable --> Cat5e, Cat5, Cat6 --> In general, higher numbers represent faster speeds \
and higher frequencies, measured Mhz
thinnet v/s thicknet
phone has built-in Wireless NIC

4. Servers, Clients, Ports and Protocols
Why we need a network? Share resources between nodes
--> Client - Server model
--> Server --> provides a service or functionality to clients \
in what's called a client - server model
--> Client accesses a service provided by a server, \
typically, the server is a different computer or different computing device \
to the client across a network
==> So we are going to access a service hosted by a server across a network
--> Server --> Distributed server for handling milliions of requests
--> A content delivery network (CDN) is a group of geographically distributed servers \
that speed up the delivery of web content by bringing it closer to where users are.

--> Server will be listening on different port numbers for different protocols
--> Protocols --> Basically a set of rules (a set of conventions) \
used for communication between devices
--> Server can run multiple services and provide multiple services to clients \
in client - sever model
--> A port is like an application on the server, so if you want to access \
this certain application, you have to request its protocol,
--> There are often many ports are opened on one server, \
each port uses its own protocol, each port is associated with a specific service on the server.
--> HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol --> uses Port 80
--> HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure --> uses Port 443
--> FTP: File Transfer Protocol --> uses Port 21 (and 20)
--> http://example.com:80
https is a protocol
:// is just syntax.
example.com is the domain.
example is the domain name.
.  is just syntax too.
com  is the top-level domain.
:  is just syntax too.
80 is the port number.

5. Practical Demonstration using Packet Tracer
--> In networking we use network diagrams to explain what a network looks like
--> Straight Through Ethernet Cable v/s Crossover Ethernet Cable (1 - 3, 2 - 6) (8 pins)
--> Straight Through Ethernet Cable --> Computer with Modem/Hub/Router --> Not same
--> Crossover Ethernet Cable --> Computer with Computer / Router with Router --> Same
--> Back in the day, use Crossover Ehternet Cable to allow PC to talk to PC
--> These days, we use Auto MDI-X ports to fix this issue
--> Auto MDI-X ports on a new network interfaces detect if the connection \
would require a crossover, and automatically chooses the MDI or MDI-X configuration \
to properly match the other end of the link
--> MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers, and are \
therefore often refered to as the burned-in address, or Ehternet hardware address, \
hardware address, and physical address
--> Each address can be stored in hardware, such as the card's read-only memory, \
or by firmware mechanism
--> Firmware is software that provides basic machine instructions \
that allow the hardware to function and communicate with other software \
running on a device. Firmware provides low-level control for a device's hardware

--> To allow 2 devices to communicate to each other, we need a MAC address and \
an IP address

+++ MAC address +++
--> MAC addresses: 0003.E435.C7DE or 11.22.11.22.11.22 --> Twelve hexadecimal numbers
--> MAC addresses are recognizable by hyphens, colons, or without a separator
--> [11-22-33]-[44-55-66]
--> The first 3 bytes identify the munufacturer of the Network Interface Card (NIC)
--> The last 3 bytes are a unique number from the manufacturer \
that identifies each device on a network

--> Windows --> 11-22-33-44-55-66
--> Apple & Linux --> 11:22:33:44:55:66
--> Cisco --> 1122.3344.5566

--> The purpose of the MAC address?
--> The purpose of the MAC address is so network devices \
can communicate with each other
--> If devices talk to each other using the MAC address. \
What is the purpose of an IP address?

--> IPv4 v/s IPv6
--> IP address --> Internet Protocol Address
+ A numeric address
+ It's an identifier for a computer or device on a network
+ Every device has to have an IP address for communication purposes
+ Consists of 2 parts: A network address and A host address
+ 2 types: IPv4 & IPv6
--> === IPv4 ===
+ IPv4 is the current version (not for long) of IP addresses
+ 32-bit numeric address written as four numbers separated by periods
+ 11.11.11.[11] --> Octet [0 - 255] --> Each group of number is called Octet
+ Computer doesn't understand IP address like: 66.94.29.13
+ Computer only understands number in a binary format: 01000010.01011110.00011101.00001101
--> 01000010.01011110.00011101.00001101
+ One Octet is 8 bit --> represented by a number from 0 to 255 --> IPv4 is 32 bit
+ Convert number in [0, 255] in binary format [2^7|2^6|2^5|2^4|2^3|2^2|2^1|2^0]
--> IPv4 produces over 4 billion address --> Not enough --> IPv6 comes into play
--> === IPv6 ===
+ IPv6 is the next generation of IP addresses
+ 128 bit hexadecimal address
--> 76DC:4F59:34CF:71CD:76DC:4F59:34CF:71CD (8 Octets)
--> Capable of producing over 340 undecillion (340 and 36 digits number) addresses
--> Binary format of IPv6 --> 8 Octets --> 16 bit --> Add up to 128 bit
--> Each hexadecimal character represents 4 bit

--> MAC address explained, Public IP address v/s Private IP address

--> Practice --> Change MAC address --> 0001.1111.1111 & 0001.2222.2222

+++ IP address +++
In network, a server (which could be a home router)
--> allocate IP addresses to PC using a protocol DHCP (a network management protocol)
--> DHCP is allocating IP addresses to PC
--> DHCP --> The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol \
is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol networks \
whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and \
other network configuration protocol parameters \
(subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server,...) \
to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks
--> PC has received an IP address automatically from a DHCP server or \
it could be configured statically
--> In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer needs to be manually assigned \
an IP address, or it can use a special link local IP address to allow \
communication on the local network
--> 2 types: Static IP address & Dynamic IP address
--> DHCP
--> Dynamic IP address are leased
--> Reservations --> Remeber MAC address \
--> provide the same IP address (Printer, Server, Router,...)
--> DHCP is a service that runs on a server, \
such as Microsoft server or a Linux server. \
It's also a service that runs on routers
--> Pratice --> Change IP Address and Subnet Mask
--> IP Address --> PC - 10.1.1.1 --> Server - 10.1.1.2
--> Subnet Mask --> 255.255.255.0

--> On the PC, use a special application called Ping \
to verify connectivity to the server (ping 10.1.1.2) \
to verify that server is up
--> Ping on Client says 'Hello server! Are you there?'
--> Server replies back 'Yes! I'm here!'
--> The point --> Notice a whole bunch of services running on a server \
HTTP, FTP, DNS, Email,...
--> DNS --> Domain Name System --> allows to resolve domain names \
such as Google.com, Facebook.com to an IP address
--> The server is configured with the HTTP Service and \
it's serving a web page to the client when the client requests a web page
--> Simulation mode of Packet Tracer --> OSI model & TCP/IP model
--> TCP - Transmission Control Protocol --> gives us reliability \
in a network transmission
--> The client talks to the server on port 80 and then \
the server replies back from port 80 to a port number that the client randomly decided to use
--> Syn --> Syn / Ack --> Ack
--> Fin --> Fin / Ack --> Ack
