1. What is a network?

--> Social media network
--> A computer network --> Digital telecommunications
--> A network is just a computers connected to each other to exchange information
Why do we need a computer network? --> Share resources between nodes
nodes --> computing devices --> files, share a printer (an end device),...
Share resources using Data-Link (media) --> Fiber optic cable, Wifi,...
Sneakernet (Floppy disk, USB - Universal Serial Bus,...)

2. Most basic type of network

Internet (Networks...)
--> Copper Ethernet Cable
--> UTP --> Unshielded Twisted Pair copper cable --> RJ45 Connector
Computer --> Network Interface Card --> RJ45 <-- NIC <-- PC
Network Interface Card (NIC) has MAC address (Media Access Control address)
--> A MAC address (A Media Access Control address) \
is a unique identifier assigned to a Network Interface Card (NIC) \
for use as a network address in communications within a network segment
NIC and Wireless NIC
10base5 --> 10base2 --> RJ45
Adapter (convert port)
---------[]
Cat5e Ethernet cabling UTP - RJ45 Connector
Use Wifi to share file (Wifi in this context is medium or media)
--> Airdrop creates its own Wifi network that allows two devices \
to share files without the need for any other Wifi networks

--> Twisted Pair Cable --> Used on Local Area Network (UTP v/s STP)
--> 568A

--> Straight Through Ethernet Cable --> Connect dissimilar divices --> Computer to (Switch, Router, Modem)
+ 568A to 568A
+ 568B to 568B
--> Crossover Ethernet Cable --> Cat5, Cat5e (1 Gbps)
+ 568A to 568B
+ 568B to 568A

3. A bit of networking history

Ethernet starts with 10base5 --> bus network or bus topology
device --> data --> medium --> data --> device
Cat = Category of cable --> Cat5e, Cat5, Cat6 --> In general, higher numbers represent faster speeds \
and higher frequencies, measured Mhz
thinnet v/s thicknet
phone has built-in Wireless NIC

4. Servers, Clients, Ports and Protocols

--> Servers
--> A server is not just a physical computer, \
a server is actually a role that a computer takes
--> Types of server --> types of services that servers provide \
--> Web server | Database server | Email server

--> Ports
What is a port?
--> A port is NOT a physical connection
--> It's a logical connection that's used by programs and services to exchange information
--> It specifically determines which program or service on a computer or sever \
that is going to be used (Web page, FTP, Email,...)
--> Port will have a unique number that identifies them (0 - 65535)
80 --> HTTP
443 --> HTTPS
21 --> FTP
25 --> Email (SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

--> IP addresses v/s Ports
--> A port is always associated with an IP address --> 11.11.11.11:80
--> An IP address determines the location of the server
--> A port number determines which service or program on the server it wants to use
--> Don't see the IP address or the port number that's being used --> Netstat --> netstat -n

--> Port Numbers \
+ System / Well-known ports (0 - 1023)
+ User / Registerd ports (1024 - 49151)
+ Dynamic / Private ports (49152 - 65535)

--> FTP --> File Transfer Protocol
--> File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the standard protocol that is used to transfer files \
between computers and servers over a TCP/IP network
--> In a nutshell, FTP is like a language that computers use...
--> FTP & SFTP --> TCP \
+ SFTP (SSH)
+ FTPS (TLS / SSL)
--> TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) --> Used on local network --> UDP (not reliable)

--> TCP v/s UDP - Connection-Oriented Protocol v/s Connectionless-Oriented Protocol
--> The communication between two computers needs to be "good" and reliable, \
to guarantee that the data is received correctly
--> TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol and this is one of the main protocols \
used in a TCP/IP Network
--> TCP guarantees that all the data is received (intact) and in order
--> TCP is a Connection-Oriented Protocol --> means that it must first acknowledge a session \
between the two computers that are communicating --> The two computers verify a connection \
before any communication takes place --> Thee-way handshake
--> Three-way handshake \
+ SYN
+ SYN/ACK
+ ACK
--> TCP guarantees the delivery of the data --> If a data packet goes astray and doesn't arrive, \
then TCP will resend it
--> UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol --> Connectionless-Oriented Protocol \
--> UDP does not establish a session and does not guarantee data delivery \
--> "fire-and-forget protocol"

Why do we need a network? Share resources between nodes
--> Client - Server model
--> Server --> provides a service or functionality to clients \
in what's called a client - server model
--> Client accesses a service provided by a server, \
typically, the server is a different computer or different computing device \
to the client across a network
==> So we are going to access a service hosted by a server across a network
--> Server --> Distributed server for handling millions of requests
--> A CDN - Content Delivery Network is a group of geographically distributed servers \
that speed up the delivery of web content by bringing it closer to where users are.

--> Server will be listening on different port numbers for different protocols
--> Protocols --> Basically a set of rules (a set of conventions) \
used for communication between devices
--> Server can run multiple services and provide multiple services to clients \
in client - sever model
--> A port is like an application on the server, so if you want to access \
this certain application, you have to request its protocol,
--> There are often many ports are opened on one server, \
each port uses its own protocol, each port is associated with a specific service on the server.
--> HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol --> uses Port 80
--> HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure --> uses Port 443
--> FTP: File Transfer Protocol --> uses Port 21 (and 20)
--> http://example.com:80
https is a protocol
:// is just syntax.
example.com is the domain.
example is the domain name.
.  is just syntax too.
com  is the top-level domain.
:  is just syntax too.
80 is the port number.

5. Practical Demonstration using Packet Tracer




--> Subnet Mask
--> IP address consists of 2 parts \
+ Network Address
+ Host Address
--> Subnet Mask determines Netwrk Address and Host Address
192.168.1.0   --> 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
255.255.255.0 --> 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
                 [      Network Portion    ].[ Host Portion ]
--> Subnet Mask --> 255.255.255.0 --> 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 \
+ The 1s indicate the network address
+ The 0s indicate the host address
--> Subnet Mask --> 255.255.224.0 --> 11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000

--> Why does an IP address have a network and a host part?
--> The reason for this is manageability --> It's for breaking down a large network \
into smaller networks or sub networks, which is known as subnetting
--> A broadcast --> Is when a computer sends out data to all computer on a network \
so it can locate and talk to a certain computer

--> In networking we use network diagrams to explain what a network looks like
--> Straight Through Ethernet Cable v/s Crossover Ethernet Cable (1 - 3, 2 - 6) (8 pins)
--> Straight Through Ethernet Cable --> Computer with Modem/Hub/Router --> Not same
--> Crossover Ethernet Cable --> Computer with Computer / Router with Router --> Same
--> Back in the day, use Crossover Ehternet Cable to allow PC to talk to PC
--> These days, we use Auto MDI-X ports to fix this issue
--> Auto MDI-X ports on a new network interfaces detect if the connection \
would require a crossover, and automatically chooses the MDI or MDI-X configuration \
to properly match the other end of the link
--> MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers, and are \
therefore often refered to as the burned-in address, or Ehternet hardware address, \
hardware address, and physical address
--> Each address can be stored in hardware, such as the card's read-only memory, \
or by firmware mechanism
--> Firmware is software that provides basic machine instructions \
that allow the hardware to function and communicate with other software \
running on a device. Firmware provides low-level control for a device's hardware

--> To allow 2 devices to communicate to each other, we need a MAC address and \
an IP address

--> VPN

--> Practice --> Change MAC address --> 0001.1111.1111 & 0001.2222.2222

+++ IP address +++
In network, a server (which could be a home router)
--> allocate IP addresses to PC using a protocol DHCP (a network management protocol)
--> DHCP is allocating IP addresses to PC
--> DHCP --> The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol \
is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol networks \
whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and \
other network configuration protocol parameters \
(subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server,...) \
to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks
--> PC has received an IP address automatically from a DHCP server or \
it could be configured statically
--> In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer needs to be manually assigned \
an IP address, or it can use a special link local IP address to allow \
communication on the local network
--> 2 types: Static IP address & Dynamic IP address
--> DHCP
--> Dynamic IP address are leased
--> Reservations --> Remeber MAC address \
--> provide the same IP address (Printer, Server, Router,...)
--> DHCP is a service that runs on a server, \
such as Microsoft server or a Linux server. \
It's also a service that runs on routers
--> Pratice --> Change IP Address and Subnet Mask
--> IP Address --> PC - 10.1.1.1 --> Server - 10.1.1.2
--> Subnet Mask --> 255.255.255.0

--> On the PC, use a special application called Ping \
to verify connectivity to the server (ping 10.1.1.2) \
to verify that server is up
--> Ping on Client says 'Hello server! Are you there?'
--> Server replies back 'Yes! I'm here!'
--> The point --> Notice a whole bunch of services running on a server \
HTTP, FTP, DNS, Email,...
--> DNS --> Domain Name System --> allows to resolve domain names \
such as Google.com, Facebook.com to an IP address
--> The server is configured with the HTTP Service and \
it's serving a web page to the client when the client requests a web page
--> Simulation mode of Packet Tracer --> OSI model & TCP/IP model
--> TCP - Transmission Control Protocol --> gives us reliability \
in a network transmission
--> The client talks to the server on port 80 and then \
the server replies back from port 80 to a port number that the client randomly decided to use
--> Syn --> Syn / Ack --> Ack
--> Fin --> Fin / Ack --> Ack
