1. What is a network?

--> Social media network
--> A computer network --> Digital telecommunications
--> A network is just a computers connected to each other to exchange information
Why do we need a computer network? --> Share resources between nodes
nodes --> computing devices --> files, share a printer (an end device),...
Share resources using Data-Link (media) --> Fiber optic cable, Wifi,...
Sneakernet (Floppy disk, USB - Universal Serial Bus,...)

2. Most basic type of network

Internet (Networks...)
--> Copper Ethernet Cable
--> UTP --> Unshielded Twisted Pair copper cable --> RJ45 Connector
Computer --> Network Interface Card --> RJ45 <-- NIC <-- PC
Network Interface Card (NIC) has MAC address (Media Access Control address)
--> A MAC address (A Media Access Control address) \
is a unique identifier assigned to a Network Interface Card (NIC) \
for use as a network address in communications within a network segment
NIC and Wireless NIC
10base5 --> 10base2 --> RJ45
Adapter (convert port)
---------[]
Cat5e Ethernet cabling UTP - RJ45 Connector
Use Wifi to share file (Wifi in this context is medium or media)
--> Airdrop creates its own Wifi network that allows two devices \
to share files without the need for any other Wifi networks

--> Twisted Pair Cable --> Used on Local Area Network (UTP v/s STP)
--> 568A

--> Straight Through Ethernet Cable --> Connect dissimilar divices --> Computer to (Switch, Router, Modem)
+ 568A to 568A
+ 568B to 568B
--> Crossover Ethernet Cable --> Cat5, Cat5e (1 Gbps)
+ 568A to 568B
+ 568B to 568A

3. A bit of networking history

Ethernet starts with 10base5 --> bus network or bus topology
device --> data --> medium --> data --> device
Cat = Category of cable --> Cat5e, Cat5, Cat6 --> In general, higher numbers represent faster speeds \
and higher frequencies, measured Mhz
thinnet v/s thicknet
phone has built-in Wireless NIC

4. Servers, Clients, Ports and Protocols

--> Servers
--> A server is not just a physical computer, \
a server is actually a role that a computer takes
--> Types of server --> types of services that servers provide \
--> Web server | Database server | Email server

--> Ports
What is a port?
--> A port is NOT a physical connection
--> It's a logical connection that's used by programs and services to exchange information
--> It specifically determines which program or service on a computer or sever \
that is going to be used (Web page, FTP, Email,...)
--> Port will have a unique number that identifies them (0 - 65535)
80 --> HTTP
443 --> HTTPS
21 --> FTP
25 --> Email (SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

--> IP addresses v/s Ports
--> A port is always associated with an IP address --> 11.11.11.11:80
--> An IP address determines the location of the server
--> A port number determines which service or program on the server it wants to use
--> Don't see the IP address or the port number that's being used --> Netstat --> netstat -n

--> Port Numbers \
+ System / Well-known ports (0 - 1023)
+ User / Registerd ports (1024 - 49151)
+ Dynamic / Private ports (49152 - 65535)

--> FTP --> File Transfer Protocol
--> File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the standard protocol that is used to transfer files \
between computers and servers over a TCP/IP network
--> In a nutshell, FTP is like a language that computers use...
--> FTP & SFTP --> TCP \
+ SFTP (SSH)
+ FTPS (TLS / SSL)
--> TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) --> Used on local network --> UDP (not reliable)

--> TCP v/s UDP - Connection-Oriented Protocol v/s Connectionless-Oriented Protocol
--> The communication between two computers needs to be "good" and reliable, \
to guarantee that the data is received correctly
--> TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol and this is one of the main protocols \
used in a TCP/IP Network
--> TCP guarantees that all the data is received (intact) and in order
--> TCP is a Connection-Oriented Protocol --> means that it must first acknowledge a session \
between the two computers that are communicating --> The two computers verify a connection \
before any communication takes place --> Thee-way handshake
--> Three-way handshake \
+ SYN
+ SYN/ACK
+ ACK
--> TCP guarantees the delivery of the data --> If a data packet goes astray and doesn't arrive, \
then TCP will resend it
--> UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol --> Connectionless-Oriented Protocol \
--> UDP does not establish a session and does not guarantee data delivery \
--> "fire-and-forget protocol"

Why do we need a network? Share resources between nodes
--> Client - Server model
--> Server --> provides a service or functionality to clients \
in what's called a client - server model
--> Client accesses a service provided by a server, \
typically, the server is a different computer or different computing device \
to the client across a network
==> So we are going to access a service hosted by a server across a network
--> Server --> Distributed server for handling millions of requests
--> A CDN - Content Delivery Network is a group of geographically distributed servers \
that speed up the delivery of web content by bringing it closer to where users are.

--> Server will be listening on different port numbers for different protocols
--> Protocols --> Basically a set of rules (a set of conventions) \
used for communication between devices
--> Server can run multiple services and provide multiple services to clients \
in client - sever model
--> A port is like an application on the server, so if you want to access \
this certain application, you have to request its protocol,
--> There are often many ports are opened on one server, \
each port uses its own protocol, each port is associated with a specific service on the server.
--> HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol --> uses Port 80
--> HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure --> uses Port 443
--> FTP: File Transfer Protocol --> uses Port 21 (and 20)
--> http://example.com:80
https is a protocol
:// is just syntax.
example.com is the domain.
example is the domain name.
.  is just syntax too.
com  is the top-level domain.
:  is just syntax too.
80 is the port number.

5. Practical Demonstration using Packet Tracer

+++ LAN - WAN - SUBNET +++

--> Network? --> A network is just computers connected to each other to exchange information
--> Now the most common way for computers connect to each other is by using Switch
--> Switch? --> A switch is a central wiring point with multiple ports \
so that two or more computers can connect to each other to create a network

  Computers <--> Switch    <-->  Gateway (Modem/Router)           <-->  Internet
[LAN - Local Area Network]      [ISP - Internet Service Provider]      [WAN - Wide Area Network]

--> LAN --> Local Area Network
--> LAN is a private network. It's a type of network like inside of a bulding (home, business, organization). \
So right now the computers in this network can only talk and exchange data with each other

--> Gateway --> Gateway is a modem, router combo

--> WAN --> Wide Area Network
--> A Wide Area Network is a large network of millions of computers \
that spans over a large geographical area (country, continent or even the entire globe) --> Internet

--> Subnet --> Subnetwork --> A division of a bigger network
--> Router --> Doorway or Gateway --> Devides or separates a network from another network
--> Reasons for creating subnets \
+ Manageability
+ Security
+ Performance

+++ VLAN +++

--> VLAN --> Virtual Local Area Network
--> In a VLAN, the computers, servers, and other network devices are logically connected \
regardless of their physical location
--> VLANs --> VLAN capable switch can logically create several virtual networks \
to separate the network broadcast traffic
+ Improved security
+ Traffic management
+ Make a network simpler

+++ Subnets v/s VLAN +++

--> Subnets and VLANs are used to separate or break down a network into smaller network
+ Manageability
+ Security
+ Performance
--> Subnets separate networks physically
--> VLANs separate networks virtually

--> Subnet
+ Subnet stands for subnetwork
+ A subnetwork is a smaller network within a larger network
+ Subnets are created by using routers

--> LAN - WAN - CAN - PAN - MAN - SAN \
--> PAN --> Personal Area Network --> Phones, Tablets, Desktops --> Bluetooth
--> WLAN --> Wireless Local Area Network --> is a LAN but with out using cables
--> CAN --> Campus Area Network --> A network that joins 2 or more LANs together within a limited area
--> MAN --> Metropolitan Area Network
--> SAN --> Storage Area Network

+++ Hub - Switch - Router +++

--> Hubs and Switches are used to exchange data within a local area network \
--> Not used to exchange data outside their own network \
Hub --> Only detects that a device is physically connected to it
Switch \
+ Can detect specific devices that are connected to it
+ Keeps a record of the MAC addresses of those devices --> Understand why we need MAC address
--> To exchange data outside their own network, a device \
needs to be able to read IP addresses --> A Router comes into play

--> Router --> A device that routes or forwards data from one network to another based on IP address
--> When a data packet is received from the router, the router inspects the data's IP address \
and determines if the packet was meant for its own network or if it's meant for another network
--> Receive data packet or send it off to another network
--> So a router is essentially the gateway of a network

--> Hubs and Switches are used to create networks while Routers are used to connect networks

--> Modem is what brings the Internet into your home or business
--> A modem establishes and maintains a dedicated connection to your ISP to give you access to the Internet
--> Why do we need a modem? --> Two different types of signals that are used on a computer and on the Internet
--> A computer only reads digital signals, while signals out on the Internet are analog
          <-- Digital      [Demodulate]  <-- Analog
Computer                      Modem                   Internet
          --> Digital      [Modulate]    --> Analog
--> Modem demodulates incoming analog signals into digital signal
--> Modem modulates outgoing digital signals into analog signal

--> Default Gateway
--> What is a Default Gateway? \
--> Simply put, a Default Gateway is a device that forwards data \
from one network to another. And the majority of the time, this is going to be a router

Computers <--> Switch <---> Router (Default Gateway) <--> Internet

--> A Default Gateway lets devices from one network communicate with devices on another network
--> "Default" means that designated device is the first option \
that's looked upon when data needs to exit network

--> Communicate on the same network --> Just talk directly
--> Communicate on different network --> Go through Default Gateway
--> IP Address and Subnet Mask come into play

--> A Subnet Mask reveals how many bits in the IP address are used for the network \
by masking the network portion of the IP address

--> Check if computers on the same network using IP address & Subnet Mask
--> Send an ARP broadcast out on the network to get MAC address \
+ Same network --> MAC address of computer - of host
+ Different network --> MAC address of Default Gateway

--> ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
--> Address Resolution Protocol - ARP used to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses
--> The MAC address is a physical address of a device. It's a globally unique number \
that is assigned to every Network Interface Card. Whenever a device needs to communicate \
with another device on a local area network, it needs the MAC address for that device

--> Subnet Mask
--> IP address consists of 2 parts \
+ Network Address
+ Host Address
--> Subnet Mask determines Netwrk Address and Host Address
192.168.1.0   --> 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
255.255.255.0 --> 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
                 [      Network Portion    ].[ Host Portion ]
--> Subnet Mask --> 255.255.255.0 --> 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 \
+ The 1s indicate the network address
+ The 0s indicate the host address
--> Subnet Mask --> 255.255.224.0 --> 11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000

--> Why does an IP address have a network and a host part?
--> The reason for this is manageability --> It's for breaking down a large network \
into smaller networks or sub networks, which is known as subnetting
--> A broadcast --> Is when a computer sends out data to all computer on a network \
so it can locate and talk to a certain computer

--> In networking we use network diagrams to explain what a network looks like
--> Straight Through Ethernet Cable v/s Crossover Ethernet Cable (1 - 3, 2 - 6) (8 pins)
--> Straight Through Ethernet Cable --> Computer with Modem/Hub/Router --> Not same
--> Crossover Ethernet Cable --> Computer with Computer / Router with Router --> Same
--> Back in the day, use Crossover Ehternet Cable to allow PC to talk to PC
--> These days, we use Auto MDI-X ports to fix this issue
--> Auto MDI-X ports on a new network interfaces detect if the connection \
would require a crossover, and automatically chooses the MDI or MDI-X configuration \
to properly match the other end of the link
--> MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers, and are \
therefore often refered to as the burned-in address, or Ehternet hardware address, \
hardware address, and physical address
--> Each address can be stored in hardware, such as the card's read-only memory, \
or by firmware mechanism
--> Firmware is software that provides basic machine instructions \
that allow the hardware to function and communicate with other software \
running on a device. Firmware provides low-level control for a device's hardware

--> To allow 2 devices to communicate to each other, we need a MAC address and \
an IP address

+++ MAC address +++
--> MAC addresses: 0003.E435.C7DE or 11.22.11.22.11.22 --> Twelve hexadecimal numbers
--> MAC addresses are recognizable by hyphens, colons, or without a separator
--> [11-22-33]-[44-55-66]
--> The first 3 bytes identify the manufacturer of the Network Interface Card (NIC)
--> The last 3 bytes are a unique number from the manufacturer \
that identifies each device on a network

--> Windows --> 11-22-33-44-55-66
--> Apple & Linux --> 11:22:33:44:55:66
--> Cisco --> 1122.3344.5566

--> The purpose of the MAC address?
--> The purpose of the MAC address is so network devices \
can communicate with each other

--> If devices talk to each other using the MAC address. \
What is the purpose of an IP address?

--> IPv4 v/s IPv6
--> IP address --> Internet Protocol Address
+ A numeric address
+ It's an identifier for a computer or device on a network
+ Every device has to have an IP address for communication purposes
+ Consists of 2 parts: A network address and A host address
--> 192.168.1.0 --> 192.168 --> A network address
+ The Network address identifies the specific network to which host is attached, \
and Host address uniquely identifies a host within a network
+ The distinction is important because router routes the packet according to \
a network address and don't care about host address

+ 2 types: IPv4 & IPv6
--> === IPv4 ===
+ IPv4 is the current version (not for long) of IP addresses
+ 32-bit numeric address written as four numbers separated by periods
+ 11.11.11.[11] --> Octet [0 - 255] --> Each group of number is called Octet
+ Computer doesn't understand IP address like: 66.94.29.13
+ Computer only understands number in a binary format: 01000010.01011110.00011101.00001101
--> 01000010.01011110.00011101.00001101
+ One Octet is 8 bit --> represented by a number from 0 to 255 --> IPv4 is 32 bit
+ Convert number in [0, 255] in binary format [2^7|2^6|2^5|2^4|2^3|2^2|2^1|2^0]
--> IPv4 produces over 4 billion address --> Not enough --> IPv6 comes into play
--> === IPv6 ===
+ IPv6 is the next generation of IP addresses
+ 128 bit hexadecimal address
--> 76DC:4F59:34CF:71CD:76DC:4F59:34CF:71CD (8 Octets)
--> Capable of producing over 340 undecillion (340 and 36 digits number) addresses
--> Binary format of IPv6 --> 8 Octets --> 16 bit --> Add up to 128 bit
--> Each hexadecimal character represents 4 bit

--> Public IP address v/s Private IP address
--> Two different types of IPv4 addresses: Public & Private
+++ Public IPv4 +++
--> Order Internet Service from Internet Service Provider, \
they are going to assign your modem or your router in your home or your business \
a public IP address
--> Public IP address is registered on the Internet --> gives access to the WWW
--> Public IP addresses are unique
+++ Private IPv4 +++
--> IPv4 --> IP addresses not enough --> Engineers developed private IP addresses
--> Private IP address are not publicly registerd on the Internet \
--> You can't access the Internet using private IP address

PC (private IP address) <-----> Router (Public IP address) <-----> Internet

--> Private IP addresses are only used internally (home, business, etc)
--> DHCP is a service in routers to assign private IPs
--> NAT (Network Address Translation) --> is what translates a set of IP addresses \
to another set of IP addresses
--> Private IP address has 3 classes
--> Class --- IP address range --- Default subnet mask
+ A --- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 --- 255.0.0.0 --> Large Organization
+ B --- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 --- 255.255.0.0 --> Medium Organization
+ C --- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 --- 255.255.255.0 --> Small Organization or Home

--> Public IP address v/s Private IP address
+ Unique >< Non-unique. Can be used on other private networks
+ Publicly registere on the Internet >< Not publicly registered
+ Used externally >< Used internally
+ Assigned by an ISP >< Assign by a router
+ Not free >< Free
+ Not secure >< Secure

--> VPN

--> Practice --> Change MAC address --> 0001.1111.1111 & 0001.2222.2222

+++ IP address +++
In network, a server (which could be a home router)
--> allocate IP addresses to PC using a protocol DHCP (a network management protocol)
--> DHCP is allocating IP addresses to PC
--> DHCP --> The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol \
is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol networks \
whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and \
other network configuration protocol parameters \
(subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server,...) \
to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks
--> PC has received an IP address automatically from a DHCP server or \
it could be configured statically
--> In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer needs to be manually assigned \
an IP address, or it can use a special link local IP address to allow \
communication on the local network
--> 2 types: Static IP address & Dynamic IP address
--> DHCP
--> Dynamic IP address are leased
--> Reservations --> Remeber MAC address \
--> provide the same IP address (Printer, Server, Router,...)
--> DHCP is a service that runs on a server, \
such as Microsoft server or a Linux server. \
It's also a service that runs on routers
--> Pratice --> Change IP Address and Subnet Mask
--> IP Address --> PC - 10.1.1.1 --> Server - 10.1.1.2
--> Subnet Mask --> 255.255.255.0

--> On the PC, use a special application called Ping \
to verify connectivity to the server (ping 10.1.1.2) \
to verify that server is up
--> Ping on Client says 'Hello server! Are you there?'
--> Server replies back 'Yes! I'm here!'
--> The point --> Notice a whole bunch of services running on a server \
HTTP, FTP, DNS, Email,...
--> DNS --> Domain Name System --> allows to resolve domain names \
such as Google.com, Facebook.com to an IP address
--> The server is configured with the HTTP Service and \
it's serving a web page to the client when the client requests a web page
--> Simulation mode of Packet Tracer --> OSI model & TCP/IP model
--> TCP - Transmission Control Protocol --> gives us reliability \
in a network transmission
--> The client talks to the server on port 80 and then \
the server replies back from port 80 to a port number that the client randomly decided to use
--> Syn --> Syn / Ack --> Ack
--> Fin --> Fin / Ack --> Ack
